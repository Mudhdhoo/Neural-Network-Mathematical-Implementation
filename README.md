# Neural-Network-Mathematical-Implementation
A fully mathematical implementation of a neural network using Numpy.
The data file contains code for preprocessing of images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
The acutal neural network along with functions to measure accuracy and make single predictions can be found in the Neural Network file.
The train file contains the code for training the model and computing its accuracy.
